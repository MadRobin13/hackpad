# SpotKey: The music lover's Marcopad

Spotkey is a music centered marcopad. It features 4 buttons to pause, play, skip, and replay all of your favourite songs!
It also features a rotary encoder to control the volume. I made this because who has the energy to change tabs and manage their music seperately when it could all at your fingertips!


## SpotKey Features:
- A rotary Encoder! (For volume control)
- 4 MX Cherry switches! (the perfect amount or the purpose)

*SpotKey was built using the QMK firware in C by MadRobin13.
